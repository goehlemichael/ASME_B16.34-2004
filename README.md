# ASME B16.34-2013
# Inner Diamater

## Derived from Table A-1 (page 183) of the Valves - Flanged, Threaded, and Welding End standards

## Input rating and nominal pipe size. Standard inner diameter is output in both inches and mm
## Choose between inches and DN units

### Example Input:

    class: 2500
    NPS (DN): DN250
  
### Example output:

    184.2 mm, 7.25 in
    
# Ceiling Pressure

## Derived from Table B-3M and B3 (pages. 188 - 190) of the Valves - Flanged, Threaded, and Welding End Standards

## Input rating and temperature. Ceiling pressure in bar and psig outputs for both standard and special class valves.

### Example Input:

    class: 600
    temperature: 400 Celsius

### Example output:

    Standard class 73.3 bar, Special class 100.6 bar
